# The Gradio Discord Bot<sup>BETA</sup>

The Gradio Discord Bot is a way to use any [Hugging Face Space](https://hf.space) as a Bot from within your Discord server -- *all without writing any code*.

Below, we show examples how to use the Bot in your server to:

- üåé Translate between languages
- üó£Ô∏è Convert text to speech
- üî¢ Do math calculations
- üñºÔ∏è Generate images

All for free and without having to code anything!

## Installation

Installing the Gradio Discord Bot is very simple:

1. Copy and paste the following link in your browser: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1040198143695933501&permissions=294406716480&scope=bot  

2. Choose which Discord server you'd like to add it to (you must have permissions to add Bots to that server of course)
